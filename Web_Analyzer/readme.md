# Web Analyzer

Project was created in C# using Windows Form. Type a website address and the analyzer shows results in the table or you can save them into txt file. You can choose from ComboBox which elements  will be analyzed: HTML version, charset, language, number of links, images, tables, etc. Program uses regular expression to find elements. I designed it in myself.
